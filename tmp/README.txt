This folder is for storing temporary files that cannot be ran through memory.
/tmp/unique_file_name

Generally, the message_id from the command invoker is used, as it will always be a unique identifier and can reference the original message.
Do NOT store temporary written files anywhere else, this is to prevent clutter and other obvious issues.
